📌 What does this code do? 📌

This code defines a function called "average" that calculates the average of a list of numbers. Here's how it works:

- 🧠 "sum(numbers)" adds up all the elements in the list.

- 📏 "len(numbers)" counts how many elements are in the list.

- 📤 The result is the sum divided by the number of elements — in other words, the average.

- 📋 We then use this function with a list of grades "([15, 18, 12, 14, 17])".

- 🖨️ The result is printed with two decimal places using ":.2f".
